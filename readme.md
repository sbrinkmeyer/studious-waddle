## intro

i've no idea what i'm doing but i want to make an interactive map that will zoom in a region and add color and the name of the space. the intention is learning. cause, i was thinking to myself at the beginning of march 2024; what is the largest city in this county of texas. and i was like. yeah that'd be cool, i want to do that but i don't have a clue.

i've been trying to convince myself i'm a full stack developer by doing tonnes and tonnes of trainings. and i'm suffering heavily from the imposter syndrome. i'm hoping that this will help me grow and overcome that.
